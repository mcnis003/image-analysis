seed_color_imagej_vn.txt
--------------

These are ImageJ macros. I developed these to be run as a script. They were written to gather color and size data from oat seeds.

seed_color_r_vn.R
--------------

This is the a companion R script to seed_color_imagej_vn.txt. It is used to gather the many data files created in ImageJ and genotypic data gathered from T3/Oat. The script then run gwas() from rrBlup.
