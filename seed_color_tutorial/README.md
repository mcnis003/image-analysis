These are scripts that be used in ImageJ and R to phenotype seeds. The script should work well for most small grains and other plants with oval shaped seeds. It will probably work poorly with other shapes of seeds. To use these scripts just place the contents of this folder into a fresh directory on your computer. Then change the file pathway variable in ImageJ and setwd() in R to the directory on your computer with the photos. 4 result files should be produced for each photo. The R script will combine these results into a single convenient table.
